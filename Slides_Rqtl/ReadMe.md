## Slides for R/qtl workshop

These slides are cobbled-together from my
[lectures on QTL mapping](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_JAXsysgen)
from the Jackson Lab Short Course on Systems Genetics.

I don't include any R code here, but just the slides and figures.
See the
[original repository](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_JAXsysgen) for
code on how the Figures were created.
